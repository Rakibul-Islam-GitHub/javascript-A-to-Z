In this repository, I wanted to practice all the necessary topics in JavaScript, especially ES6 Syntax. I have also practiced some common problem like `finding prime number`, `find fibonacci`, `word count`, `swaping number`, `reversing string`, some `conditional problems`, `array problem` and `object`. From ES6, I have covered `array map`, `arrow function`, `class`, `templete literals`, `sprade operator` etc. I also practiced Â DOM related problem and made some project.
I will continuously update and add more practical examples using JavaScript here.

I have built some practical projects using the topic mentioned above:
