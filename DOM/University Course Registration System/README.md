### What I learned
The main objective of this project was to brush up & get experience by working with `HTML DOM` . Every time a user added a new course, it will dynamically create html element by javascript with id so in that case to delete the course we need to use `event delegation`. which concept is also a good learning point there. So overall it was a easy and simple project to using different DOM concepts like: `getElementById`, `addEventListener`, `createElement`, `setAttribute`, `appendChild`, `getElementsByClassName` etc.
